# Getting-started-with-the-Tactigon-board
Here you can find everything that you need to get started with the Tactigon board.

## Final test
Once you are familiar with the main functions of the Tactigon board try taking a look at the [final scketch](https://github.com/TactigonTeam/Getting-started-with-the-Tactigon-board/blob/master/All_Sensors_BLE.ino) to better understand how to handle things like:
* get IMU data and expose them on differerent BLE characteristics
* add a characteristic with input GPIOs status
* leds handling and blink function
* I/O debouncing
